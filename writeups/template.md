### Process 

In my SEP class I am learning how to make websites. I learned about a elements herf and more. But sometimes I get stuck like the FreeCodeCamp. I think I was stuck on the "Link to External Pages with Anchor Elements" I kept on looking at one line of code but when I just at all of it. The mistake was that I copy it on top and I forgot about it. also when they just told as to nest it without showing it to us that was hard. When I made it to class and val went up and coded when she did nest I understand it better on how to do it nest. When I took the check in I got this question wrong "Which is the correct syntax for making an image a clickable link? (assume "#" refers to proper URLs)" I put 
```<img href="#"><a src="#"></img>``` which was wrong the right one was ```<a href="#"><img src="#"></a>```


* Tip if you get stuck read the reread the WHOLE CODE.
* To create an internal link, you assign a links href attribute to a hash symbol # plus the value of the id attribute for the element that you want to internally link to, usually farther down the page. You then need to add the same id attribute to the element you are linking to. An id is an attribute that uniquely describes an element. 

*To make a word a link do this  
```<p> im a paragraph <a href=#>im a link to nowhere</p></a>```
*A (anchor) elements can also be used to create internal links to jump to different sections within a webpage.
