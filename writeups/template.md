In my SEP class I am learning how to make websites. I learned about a elements herf and more. But sometimes I get stuck like the FreeCodeCamp. I think I was stuck on the "Link to External Pages with Anchor Elements" I kept on looking at one line of code but when I just at all of it. The mistake was that I copy it on top and I forgot about it.
